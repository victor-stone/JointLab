JointLab
========

This is lab in which I take the SKPhysicsJoints out for a test drive.

It was done in XCode Version 6.0 (6A215l) using Swift

You can see the following joint types in action:

SKPhysicsJointPin
SKPhysicsJointFixed
SKPhysicsJointSliding
SKPhysicsJointSpring
SKPhysicsJointLimit

They all seem to be functional in this Beta 

I've never done a SpriteKit or Swift project before so any helpful hints 
for preventing stoopid rookie stuff are welcome.
